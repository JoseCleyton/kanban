# Kanban

## Description

This project was developed for an Ada Tech challenge.

## General observations


Unfortunately, I didn't have enough personal time to do everything I wanted to do. I would have liked to have included NgRx for state management, added more unit tests and other improvements.

## Design and Architecture

In this project I used Smart and Dumb components to perform the rendering and logic of the components. To learn more about this approach, I suggest reading a short article I wrote on Medium: [Smart e Dumb Components](https://medium.com/@cleytoncomp/smart-e-dumb-components-201a7ade868e).

## Main Technologies Used

[Angular 14.2.9](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
[Angular Material 14.2.7](https://material.angular.io/)
[Bootstrap 5.2.2](https://getbootstrap.com/)
[RxJs 7.5.0](https://rxjs.dev/)
[Jest 28.1.3](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/)
 
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
